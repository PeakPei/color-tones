ColorTones is an iOS Core Audio sample project that builds on several basic principles of musical instrument design: triggers, envelopes, wave generators. 

It includes CTMusicHelper, a class which ports concepts from the Overtone project to Objective C, by making use of OCTotallyLazy - a functional programming extension to Objective C collections.
